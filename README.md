# MoneyManager

Thank you for checking out our app, MoneyManager. 
MoneyManager was created to help keep track of the big things in life, so you can focus on the little things. 
You can track the money in your accounts, set goal amounts to save up for that big purchase, and keep an eye on any unapproved expenditures. 

## Features
Right now, you can add Checking Accounts, Savings Accounts and Retirement Accounts. We also have an Expense category for each of the accounts to show upcoming bills that are due and their amounts.

## Future Features
We would like to be able to show all the accounts associated with a user account.
We would also like to be able to show a Front End for the user to be able to use the features we have set up.
We would also like to be able to link with a bank account so when purchases are made they can show up in the App.
A nice feature would to be able to send an email to the user with a summary of their accounts.
